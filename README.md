# ten compliments

Ten Compliments is a fun project I came up with on my birthday. I wanted a way to thank everyone who said "Happy Birthday" to me, so I decided to build an application where I can give them ten compliments, (ten things I love about them!).

I also wanted to allow them to interact with the site by sending ten compliments to their own loved ones and friends as well!

I created this app using my new Ruby on Rails skills. I started out as a non-techie from a different industry, and you can read all about that in my blog <a href="http://twonontechies.com">here</a>!
