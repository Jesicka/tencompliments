<h1>about ten compliments</h1>
<h3>send 10 compliments to your friends!</h3>
<h2>ten compliments is a fun project I came up with on my birthday. I wanted a way to thank everyone who said "Happy Birthday" to me on facebook, so I decided to build an application where I can give them each ten compliments, (ten things I love about them!)</h2>
<p>
<h2>I also wanted to allow them to interact with the site by sending ten compliments to their own loved ones and friends as well!</h2>
<p>
<h2>I created this app using my newly learned Ruby on Rails skills. I started out as a non-techie from a different industry (other than coding), and you can read all about that <a href="http://twonontechies.com">here</a>!</h2>
